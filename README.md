This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Promptopia is an open-source AI prompting tool designed for the modern world, allowing users to discover, create, and share creative prompts. It is built using  [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for both the frontend and backend, and utilizes MongoDB as the database. The authentication system is implemented using NextAuth.js. This project was developed with the teaching and guidance provided by JavaScript Mastery.
